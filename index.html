        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>ahlan soly, We met on February 8th, 2022, and since then, my life has changed significantly because of you. You've brought light into it. We have a lot in common, which makes our bond strong. I think one reason we've grown close is our deep trust; we've shared secrets and talked about our private lives openly. I always try my best to make you happy and show my love in various ways. Sometimes, I worry that I might come across as annoying because I'm always trying to express my love. However, I want you to know that I'll always be by your side, ready to help with anything, no matter the cost.</p>

            <p>It's a shit picture, I know. it was 6 am in the morning crying my way to school, knowing that I will spend the next year without seeing my family, friends and especially you. for some reason I kept overthinking at that moment how me being away from the people I love will effect my relation with them, especially you. 19/10/2022</p>

            <p>When you truly love someone, you dedicate your life to them. You hold onto them until you're breathless, regardless of how they treat you. Love remains an enigmatic force, far beyond our comprehension. I love you more than anything, clinging to you because my love for you is genuine. This photo captures a moment when we reunited after over a year of separation, and it felt as if I had been seeing you every day. You are my soulmate 16/8/2023</p>
